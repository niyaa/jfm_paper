\maketitle

Movie1.mp4:
Flow evolution throughout the linear amplification process captured for the $CP_2$ case. The process is started with small amplitude Gaussian noise perturbation and traced up to and past the onset of nonlinear interactions at saturation time $T_s$. Conditions correspond to $A=0.462$, $Re=300$ and $\beta=0.292$ ($Re_{cr}=296$, $\beta_{cr}=0.292$).
In the upper left corner, towards the negative $z$, iso-surfaces of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor taken at $80\%$ of the instantaneous maximum and coloured by streamwise vorticity also scaled by respective instantaneous maximum.
Towards the positive $z$-direction, streamwise velocity iso-surface at $w=0.2$ and coloured according to the spanwise velocity component $u$ along with iso-surfaces of the absolute second invariant of the velocity gradient at $Q=1.5\cdot10^{-4}$ (appearing around saturation time $Ts$).
The same is shown from the top perspective in the top-right part.
In the bottom scaled streamwise vorticity (left) and streamwise velocity (right).

Movie2.mp4:
Flow evolution throughout the linear amplification process captured for the $CP_3$ case. The process is started with small amplitude Gaussian noise perturbation and traced up to and past the onset of nonlinear interactions at saturation time $T_s$. Conditions correspond to $A=0.455$, $Re =340$ and $\beta=0.281$ ($Re_{cr}=313$, $\beta_{cr}=0.281$). Composition is the same as in $CP_2$ case, with iso-surfaces of the absolute second invariant of the velocity gradient at $Q=5\cdot10^{-4}$ (also appearing around saturation time $T_s$).
