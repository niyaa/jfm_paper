abstract = {Flow visualization has demonstrated that the critical Reynolds number for flow instability in the narrow gap of an annular channel with a diameter ratio of about 0.28 increases with increasing eccentricity e in the range 0.5<e<0.8. The critical Reynolds numbers in the wide gap at all eccentricities and in the narrow gap for 0<e<0.5 seem to be insensitive to eccentricity. These observations and comparison of the frequencies of transverse flow oscillations at different Reynolds numbers and different eccentricities demonstrate that at least two distinct instability mechanisms are present in annular flows. The one of particular interest in this work arises in narrow gaps and is attributed to the instability of the two shear layers forming on either side of the gap. Linear stability analysis demonstrated that the basic flow in concentric annuli is stable for the considered diameter ratio and range of Reynolds numbers. In contrast, the basic flow in eccentric annuli has an azimuthal variation that contains two inflection points, thus being potentially linearly unstable.}

	abstract = {It is difficult to mix solutions in microchannels. Under typical operating conditions, flows in these channels are laminar{\textemdash}the spontaneous fluctuations of velocity that tend to homogenize fluids in turbulent flows are absent, and molecular diffusion across the channels is slow. We present a passive method for mixing streams of steady pressure-driven flows in microchannels at low Reynolds number. Using this method, the length of the channel required for mixing grows only logarithmically with the P{\'e}clet number, and hydrodynamic dispersion along the channel is reduced relative to that in a simple, smooth channel. This method uses bas-relief structures on the floor of the channel that are easily fabricated with commonly used methods of planar lithography.},

We suggest that {\textquoteleft}designing for chaos{\textquoteright}, that is, basing practical mixer design on chaotic advection analysis, is a promising approach to adopt in this developing field which otherwise has little to guide it and is constrained by issues of scale and manufacturability.},
